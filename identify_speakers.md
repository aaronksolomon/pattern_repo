-Identify the speakers in the following text transcript that has been extracted from an audio file.

-Mark lines where a speaker begins speaking with the name or identity of the speaker if it can be determined from context, as in:
    JIM SMITH:  text...
    
-if the identity cannot be determined by context use:
    SPEAKER X: text ...
        (where X is the number of the speaker, in order of speakers)

-It is not necessary to mark ever line of the text, only mark changes in speaker according to your best inference.

-Do not otherwise modify the text.

-Do not add commentary or any special symbols of formatting such as `, *, $, #
